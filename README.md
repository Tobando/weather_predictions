# Weather Predictions – Air Pollution Forecasting with Machine Learning

## Project Description

Air pollution poses a major risk to human health, particularly in urban areas where emissions from traffic and industry are dense. This project aims to predict pollution levels (such as PM2.5, NO₂, and ozone) using historical data and weather patterns.

By leveraging machine learning models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, the project identifies trends and helps forecast future pollution levels — enabling communities, policymakers, and individuals to better prepare for poor air quality days.
